# Shornbee No Snob Language Policy

Shornbee intentionally uses only three measures because they are the first three things most people feel when they drink red wine:

1. Heavy ↔ Light
2. Fruity ↔ Dry
3. Smooth ↔ Bright

This product avoids critic-style complexity and technical wine jargon so MD users can choose confidently and quickly.
